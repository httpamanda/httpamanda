## About me
Hello, I'm Amanda! I currently work as an Automation Engineer and am pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development at PUC GoiÃ¡s. I'm always looking to improve my skills by taking online courses, reading books, and engaging in developer communities. Additionally, I'm passionate about teaching, and in my spare time, I work as an English teacher, which brings me great joy.
